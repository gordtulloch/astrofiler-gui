AstroFiler is a powerful Python application designed for astronomers and astrophotographers to efficiently manage, organize, and catalog their astronomical image files. With support for both FITS and XISF formats (input only) and an intuitive graphical interface, it provides tools for batch processing, file organization, metadata extraction, and session analysis.
