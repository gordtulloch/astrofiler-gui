AstroFiler 1.2.0 BETA – New Features

I’ve been heads-down on AstroFiler and just pushed a major 1.2.0 update focused on calibration automation, quality metrics, and safer repository/cloud workflows. All batchable functions in the GUI have been implemented as command line utilities to facilitate automation. 

Highlights:

Advanced quality analysis 

Real quantitative metrics per light frame: FWHM, eccentricity, HFR, SNR, star count, and image scale
Robust (SEP-based) star detection
Metrics stored in the database automatically (so they’re searchable and can drive workflows)

Auto-Calibration system

Automated master bias/dark/flat creation and tracking
Batch light-frame calibration with correct correction order and proper provenance
Session-aware master selection (telescope/instrument/binning/temp/filter matching)
FITS headers updated with calibration history + master references (counts/checksums/timestamps)

Stacking for Image Previews

Automated image stacking to create thumbnails displayed in Sessions menu
Image registration with Astroalign before stacking
Pretty Picture / Deepsky stacking with sigma clipping
Photometric safe stacking (star-registers frames (astroalign), then combines via mean with no sigma clipping, and writes float32 FITS to preserve linear photometry.) to support Photometry in version 1.3

Cloud Sync (Google Cloud Storage)

Full GUI-driven sync with profiles (Complete / Backup / On-Demand) and analysis mode
Cloud URL tracking in the DB, improved matching, and hash-based duplicate prevention
Safer cleanup behavior: verification before deleting local files in backup-style workflows
Backup soft deleted files (e.g. raw images after calibration completed) and remove from repo

New tabbed configuration dialog (General / Cloud / Calibration / Smart Telescopes) to reduce clutter and make setup clearer
Smart telescope integration upgrades

iTelescope support (secure FTPS download + calibrated file discovery)
Stellarmate support (SMB access to pictures folder)
Improved telescope download workflows with metadata extraction and progress reporting

FITS handling and automation improvements

Lossless FITS compression support integrated into the ingest workflow
Expanded CLI tooling and more consistent logging for unattended runs

If anyone wants to kick the tires, I’d love feedback specifically on: (1) calibration/master matching behavior, (2) quality metric usefulness, and (3) cloud sync reliability on large repos.
