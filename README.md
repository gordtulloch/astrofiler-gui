AstroFiler is a powerful application designed for astronomers and astrophotographers to efficiently manage, organize, and catalog their FITS image files. With an intuitive graphical interface, it provides tools for batch processing, file organization, metadata extraction, session analysis, and direct integration with smart telescopes for seamless data acquisition. Detailed documentation is in the Github Wiki.

**Current Status**: Release V1.1.0

## üöÄ Quick Installation

AstroFiler includes automated installation scripts for all major platforms:

### Windows
Install Git - There are also a few ways to install Git on Windows. The most official build is available for download on the Git website. Just go to https://git-scm.com/download/win and the download will start automatically. Note that this is a project called Git for Windows, which is separate from Git itself; for more information on it, go to https://gitforwindows.org.

Once git is installed, you can open a powershell command line (run as Admin) and enter:

```powershell
C:
cd \
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope LocalMachine -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
git clone https://github.com/gordtulloch/astrofiler-gui.git
cd astrofiler-gui
.\install\install.ps1
```

### Linux
In Linux you can install git from Debian distros via:

```bash
apt install git      # Debian distros
sudo yum install git # CentOS distros
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/gordtulloch/astrofiler-gui.git
cd astrofiler-gui
chmod +x install/install.sh && ./install/install.sh
```

### macOS
There are several ways to install Git on macOS. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time.

```bash
git --version # If you don‚Äôt have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.
git clone https://github.com/gordtulloch/astrofiler-gui.git
cd astrofiler-gui
chmod +x install/install_macos.sh && ./install/install_macos.sh
```

**What the installer does:**
- Checks for Python 3.8+ (installs if needed)
- Creates virtual environment
- Installs all dependencies
- Creates desktop shortcuts and application menu entries
- Sets up automatic update checking from GitHub

**Auto-Update Feature:**
Desktop launchers automatically check for and install updates from GitHub when starting AstroFiler (if installed via git clone).

üìñ **See the Wiki for detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting.**

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Migrations

AstroFiler uses `peewee-migrate` for database version control and schema migrations. This ensures smooth upgrades when the database structure changes in future versions.

### For Users
- **Automatic Migration**: When you start AstroFiler, any pending database migrations are automatically applied
- **No Manual Action Required**: The application handles database updates transparently
- **Backup Recommended**: While migrations are tested, it's always good practice to backup your `astrofiler.db` file before major updates

### For Developers
Database schema changes are managed through migrations:

```bash
# Check current migration status
python migrate.py status

# Create a new migration
python migrate.py create add_new_field

# Run pending migrations
python migrate.py run

# Initial database setup
python migrate.py setup
```

See [MIGRATIONS.md](MIGRATIONS.md) for detailed migration development guidelines.
