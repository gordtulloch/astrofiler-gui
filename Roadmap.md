# Development Roadmap for Astrofiler

*V1.0.0*  Basic functions to load and manage repositories, merge objects, create sessions, match sessions for lights and calibrations, and sign out sessions for processing.
*V1.1.0*  Auto-calibration of light frames if calibration frames are detected, calibration master frames, sample stacks of objects, handling for specific FITS situations (DRWARF III), email to end user with nightly results, mapping of fields for defaults/correction
*V1.2.0*  Checkin function to add processing artifacts to the repo, XISF/TIF/JPG support

Any feature requests will be considered for slotting into one of these versions. Bug fixes will be minor releases (1.0.1). V1.1.0 expected in early September.
